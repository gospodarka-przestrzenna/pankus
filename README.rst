Pankus
==========

Set of tools for spatial-economical-potential analysis.

Project aims to provide python functions (building blocks) that help particular
modeling process. Python functions are injecting SQL queries into SQLite database
(eventually Geopackage) and complete them with expressions eliminating the need to write complicated code in SQL.

Described building blocks may be used to present the basic idea (steps of modeling process)
without going into details.
