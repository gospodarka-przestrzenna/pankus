Effect
------
- ``model_parameters`` table is updated.
- Each origin/destination point's origins are set to be the sum of arriving motions (from motion exchange)
- Each origin/destination computation area's destinations are set to be the sum of arriving motions (from motion exchange) normalized to keep the total sum of initial destinations unchanged.
