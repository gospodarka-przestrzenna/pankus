    Origin/destination point
      Point usually representing geographically determined area (computation area) which generates or aggregates motions

    Origins
      Potential of origin/destination point to generate motion e.g.: Number of working people

    Destinations
      Potential of origin/destination point to aggregate motion e.g.: Number of work places 

    Interaction (spatial interaction)
      Interaction is a character of a single pair of origin/destination points (representing computation areas) connection

    Connection
      Connection describes link between two points. There may be multiple connections between two points.

    Distance
      Distances specify route between pairs of origin/destination areas combined from multiple connections.

    Convolution

    Computation area
      Determined area (usually geographically) pankus calculations apply to e.g.: urban unit
      
    Weight of connection
      A cost of connection - better condition minimalize the weight
